# KATA TRACKER

This project is an attempt at a heroku one-click-install practise aid.

The goal is to have a tool with the following features:
- stores katas and information about their sources
- sends reminders to establish a routine of practicing these katas and learning new ones
- needs to be a personal, and easily personalized, hub for routine
  exercises

## planned features
- [ ] secure user authentication
- [ ] add katas and links to where you found them 
- [ ] track kata completion, and the languages they've been completed in
- [ ] e-mail reminders to reinforce a daily kata routine
- [ ] one click heroku install
- [ ] oauth login via github account
